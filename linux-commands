Linux files consist on 3 different categories
1.	General file: it could be a simple file e.g txt or image
2.	Directory file: it is folder structure e.g subdirectories
3.	Device files: tree structure e.f /dev/sda
Tree of directories start from root (/) and every file have special role in organizing system file, user data and configuration
1.	/bin - Contains essential binary or executable programs required for basic system operation.
2.	/etc - Stores system-wide configuration files used to control system behavior.
3.	/home - Contains user home directories and serves as the default working directory for users.
4.	/opt - Holds optional or third-party software packages installed separately from the system.
5.	/tmp - Provides temporary storage space for files, which is typically cleared on system reboot.
6.	/usr - Contains user-related programs, utilities, and shared resources.
7.	/var - Stores variable data such as log files that change frequently during system operation.

Week 1 – Linux Basics: Filesystem & Navigation (Done)
----------------------------------------------
📂 Commands: pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, touch, tree
📝 Tasks:
- Navigate directories
- Create folders & files
- Explore hidden files (ls -a)
Mini-project: Build a project folder structure and navigate it

Week 2 – File Operations & Permissions (Done)
--------------------------------------
📂 Commands: cp, mv, rm, chmod, chown, chgrp
📝 Tasks:
- Copy, move, rename, delete files
- Change file permissions and ownership
Mini-project: Set up a folder with restricted permissions
So basically we need 2 commands to provide permission chmod and chown. chown is use for change the owner and chmod use for change of group. So means every file on directory we hav 3 permission groups e.g Owner, Group and other.
d rwx rwx r-w
d (directory in case of folder)  rwx (Owner) rwx (Group)  r-x (All User)
1.	For Change owner: chown (new owner name) filename --- this is use for change file owner only
To change file owner and group: sudo chown saqib:saqib filename
2.	Chmod (change mode) r= 4, w=2 and x=1
Chmod 664 filename
While common permission as below
644- file basline
755 – directory basline
400 – key pair 


Week 3 – Processes & Jobs
-------------------------
📂 Commands: ps, top, htop, kill, pkill, &, jobs, fg, bg
📝 Tasks:
- List running processes
- Kill/stop processes
- Run processes in background and manage jobs
Mini-project: Monitor and restart a process like nginx

Week 4 – Services & Systemctl
-----------------------------
📂 Commands: systemctl start/stop/restart/status, service
📝 Tasks:
- Start/stop/restart services
- Check service status
Mini-project: Ensure nginx or apache is running, restart if stopped

Week 5 – Networking Basics
--------------------------
📂 Commands: ping, curl, ifconfig, ip addr, netstat, ss
📝 Tasks:
- Ping a server
- Check network interfaces and IP
- List open ports
Mini-project: Script to ping a website and log online/offline status

Week 6 – Log Files & Monitoring
-------------------------------
📂 Commands: journalctl, tail -f, cat, less, head
📝 Tasks:

- Write reusable functions in scripts
- Schedule scripts with cron
Mini-project: Daily backup script for project folders

Week 9 – Package Management & Linux Tools
-----------------------------------------
📂 Commands: apt update/install/remove, grep, awk, sed, find, tar, zip/unzip

[Your WSL Ubuntu System]
          |
          |--- ping ---▶ [Remote Server / Website]
          |        (Check if online, measure latency)
          |
          |--- curl -I ---▶ [Remote Server / Website]
          |        (Check HTTP headers, server response)
          |
          |--- netstat ---▶ [Local Ports & Connections]
          |        (Which processes are listening / connected)
          |
          |--- ifconfig ---▶ [Local Network Interfaces]
          |        (Check IP addresses, status, network config)
          |
          |--- Bash Script (uptime.sh) ---▶ Combines ping + logging
          |        (Automates monitoring website and logs results)
________________________________________
Step-by-Step Explanation
1.	Ping
o	Your system → sends “echo requests” → remote server → responds → you see latency
o	Used to check if a server is reachable
2.	Curl -I
o	Your system → sends HTTP request headers → remote server responds → you see status codes
o	Used to check if a website is running and returning 200 OK
3.	Netstat
o	Your system → lists all open network ports and their processes
o	Useful to see what is running locally (like nginx, Docker containers)
4.	Ifconfig
o	Your system → shows network interfaces (eth0, wlan0, etc.)
o	Displays IP address, MAC address, and interface status
5.	Bash Script (uptime.sh)
o	Combines ping + logic to check server availability
o	Logs the result into a file for later reference
o	Can be automated to run every minute/hour
________________________________________
Example Workflow for Monitoring a Website
1.	Use ping to check if Google is online. ✅
2.	If online, echo timestamp + status → append to status.log
3.	If not online, echo timestamp + “Down” → append to status.log
4.	Optionally check netstat to see if any services (like nginx) are running
5.	Use ifconfig if you need your local IP for testing connections
________________________________________
💡 Tip: Think of it as a flow from your machine to the network:
•	Ping → “Is the server alive?”
•	Curl → “Is the website responding properly?”
•	Netstat → “What’s happening on my machine?”
•	Ifconfig → “What’s my network configuration?”
•	Bash script → “Automate all of this and log results”
