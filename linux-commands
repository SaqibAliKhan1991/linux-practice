When you are working within a shell terminal, Linux Filesystem Navigation Basics step by step instructions
The below instructions are the absolute minimum a beginner GNU/Linux user needs to master to be able to perform even the simplest tasks on a GNU/Linux command line. Once you learn the basics below, you are ready to move to more advanced command line topics.

Step 1:  When you are working within a shell terminal, you are always operating in a particular directory. To determine which directory you are in, use the pwd command:
student@linuxconfig:$ pwd /usr/local/bin 
student@linuxconfig:$ cd 
student@linuxconfig:$ pwd /home/student 
student@linuxconfig:$

Step 2: Your home directory is the directory you are in when you first open the terminal. To go to your home directory from anywhere, just type cd command:
student@linuxconfig:$ pwd
/usr/local/bin
student@linuxconfig:$ cd
student@linuxconfig:$ pwd
/home/student
student@linuxconfig:$

Step 3: An absolute path name is one beginning with the / character, which signifies the root of the file system tree. Therefore, another way of going to your home directory is:
student@linuxconfig:/etc$ cd /home/student
student@linuxconfig:$ pwd
/home/student
student@linuxconfig:$

Step 4: A relative path is one which starts with the name of a directory connected to the current directory. For example, if you are in the /usr directory, then typing only cd bin (without preceding “bin” with “/”) has the following effect:
student@linuxconfig:$ pwd
/usr
student@linuxconfig:$ cd bin
student@linuxconfig:$ pwd
/usr/bin
student@linuxconfig:$
and you go to /usr/bin rather than /usr/local/bin or /bin.

Step 5: To go to the directory containing the current working directory (also called the parent directory) type:
student@linuxconfig:$ pwd
/usr/bin
student@linuxconfig:$ cd ..
student@linuxconfig:$ pwd
/usr
student@linuxconfig:$

Step 6: The relative pathname of the current working directory is called . (the full stop). Therefore typing:
student@linuxconfig:$ pwd
/usr/bin
student@linuxconfig:$ cd . 
student@linuxconfig:$ pwd
/usr/bin
student@linuxconfig:$

does not change the current working directory:set number.
