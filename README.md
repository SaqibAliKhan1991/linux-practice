Linux Learning Journey 🐧
Overview

This repository contains my Linux learning projects and practice exercises, aimed at building a strong foundation for DevOps engineering.
I am learning Linux fundamentals, Bash scripting, automation, Git, and basic Python, with hands-on projects to demonstrate real-world skills.

Topics Covered
1. Linux Basics
- Filesystem navigation: pwd, ls, cd, tree
- File operations: touch, mkdir, cp, mv, rm
- File permissions & ownership: chmod, chown, chgrp
- Viewing logs: cat, tail, grep
- Searching files: find, locate

Project: Practice folder structure for project organization
2. Process & Service Management
- Monitoring processes: ps, top, htop
- Killing processes: kill, pkill
- Managing services: systemctl start/stop/restart/status
Project: Monitor and restart critical services like nginx

3. Bash Scripting
- Variables, echo, and command substitution $()
- Conditionals: if, else, elif
- Loops: for, while
- Functions and arguments $1, $2
- Automation with cron jobs

  Mini-projects:
- Backup .log files with date suffix
- Disk usage monitoring and alerts
- Log rotation scripts

4. Git & GitHub
- Git setup, commits, branches, merges
- Pushing and pulling from GitHub repositories
- Version control for Linux scripts and projects

Project: Store all Bash scripts and projects in GitHub

5. Python Basics for Linux Automation

- Variables, loops, conditionals
- File handling and reading logs
- Automating tasks via Python scripts

Running Bash commands from Python using subprocess
Mini-project: Automate log backup using Python
